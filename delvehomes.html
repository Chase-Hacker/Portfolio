    <h2>Delve Homes</h2>

    <p>Delve Homes is the first major programming project I have worked on. After reading the book, “The Machine Stops” by EM Forster, me and one partner were tasked with creating a website to sell the homes that were present inside of the story. Since this was the largest project we have worked on up to that point, we were kind of nervous, but nevertheless, we persisted. We were able to Utilize both HTML to make the frame of the website, and CSS to stylize the website. This was also the first time that I began to experiment with JavaScript, by adding in sounds that would play when a user would click on a certain part of the website.</p>

    <p> Before we actually started the website, we used a myriad of different tools to help us create the best website possible. We used Figma to create the base layout of the website, VS Code to program the actual website, Pexels and Pixabay to find copyright free images, and an application called Github to share and save code. </p>
        
    <p> We were able to complete the website by the deadline, and without any major bugs. It took both me and my partner multiple hours during the weekend to completely finalize the website, but with our collaboration, we were able to fully complete the website. I would say that this project helped me vastly improve my coding skills; not only coding, but also making the code a lot more organized and easier to go back and either revise or rewrite entirely if the need arises.</p>
