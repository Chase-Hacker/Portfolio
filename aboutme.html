    <h2>Post-Secondary Plan</h2>
    <p>My plan after high school is to most likely attend college, and earn at least a bachelor's degree in computer science, or at least a relevant degree for web development. I plan to apply for either an entry level job or an internship at a tech company, and eventually find a very good career in web development.</p>
