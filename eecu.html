    <h2>EECU Budget Calculator</h2>
    <p> This EECU Budget Calculator project was inspired by the EECU Income workbook, where you would select a job and see the taxes that were deducted from the paycheck. On top of that, there was also a checkbook that you could use to keep track of withdrawals and deposits that the user might have made. This was the first ever project that utilized JavaScript, which was used to automatically calculate the amount of taxes that were owed depending on which job, without the user doing anything other than selecting which job they were interested in. JavaScript was also used to create the checkbook, which, like mentioned above, was able to calculate the numbers that were inputted into the checkbook, and determine the remaining total. I learned key JavaScript functions that would be crucial to future projects that I worked on.</p>

    <p> I relied on a multitude of different software programs to help me plan and construct the website I envisioned. One of the first was a website called Figma, which helped me create the base wireframe (prototype) of my website. I also used VS Code to actually create the website using the coding languages. Other websites that I utilized were free image sites, such as Pexels, to obtain copyright free images.</p>
    
    <p> Considering this was my first time using Javascript, I would say that the project turned out pretty well. The only thing that I would improve on now would be the look and layout of the website, since I kind of rushed it since I was so focused on the Javascript aspect of the website. </p>
