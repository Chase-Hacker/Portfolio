<h2>Cownect-4</h2>
<p> Cownect-4 was a project that was based off of the board game Connect-4. This project was created by me and a partner, with the goal of adding special twists, in order to differentiate our game from the original version. To begin making this game, my partner and I used a multitude of different applications and software. To start, we created a flowchart on LucidChart, to help us determine the overall flow and logic of the game. Another application we used was called Github, which we utilized to share and store code that we were both working on. We also used a website called Figma to create the base wireframes for what we envisioned our website to look like.</p> 	

<p> Our project utilized many different tools to help us in the development of our game. One of the most important tools was VS Code, which is where we used different coding languages to create the framework of our game. The most important language we used would be JavaScript. In order to add functionality to the game and make the events, such as deleting something, actually work, we used this language. My partner and I were able to make the game highly functional, with minimal user input. This is the second major project that I utilized javascript, and although I was still fairly new to not only programming as a whole, including javascript, this project helped me vastly improve my knowledge in the different languages that were used during the project. </p>
  
<p> The other languages we used were not as impactful, but still very important. We used CSS, to style the website and change it to look like an actual game, rather than just a colorless website that would have looked closer to a document than a fun, enjoyable game. The other language that we utilized is HTML, which is to form the basis of the page, such as the content that is viewable on the website.</p>
  
<p> Overall, I believe that me and my partner were able to utilize the minimal knowledge that we possessed, and transform it into a fully fledged game. It took tons of persistence and collaboration, but at the end of the day, Cownect-4 is one of the best projects I think I have ever created.</p>
