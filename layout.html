    <h2>Layout Practice</h2>
    <p> This Layout was for me to try and learn how to take something like a client's vision for a website, whether that be an image, a wireframe, or just a simple drawing, and transform it into a fully fledged website. The images from the layout were given to me, but everything else had to be made completely from scratch. I started Investigating some of the smaller details in the website, such as different shades of color that would blend into the area around it.</p>

    <p> For me, this entire project  was a very difficult task, because I haven't had prior experience for replicating an entire website just based off of an image. I was able to use different tools and resources such as Github, which I used to store code in case I needed to revert my website back to a different state if I ever made an error. Another one of the main resources I used was a new website called ImageColorPicker, which I used to find the exact color that was used for the image I was supposed to use. With these and a few other resources, I was able to persevere and fully replicate the image into an entirely functional website.</p>
