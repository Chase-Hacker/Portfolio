    <h3>Here are some of the projects I have contributed to.</h3>
    <div id="delve">
      My first ever Web Development project, a home building website which
      was based off of a story by EM Forster, which is called, “The Machine
      Stops”.
    </div>
    <div id="EECU">
      Inspired by EECU Income Workbook, A website to select a job and find
      out the amount of taxes are taken away from each paycheck. Includes a
      working checkbook.

    <div id="layout">
      My third Web Development project, where I took an image of a layout
      and transformed it into a fully functioning website.

    <div id="cownect4">
      My most recent project, where me and a partner were able to take a
